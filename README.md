**Smart Contract Project**
Smart Contract with require(), assert(), and revert() Statements

**Description**
This project consists of a smart contract written in Solidity that showcases the usage of the require(), assert(), and revert() statements. These statements are essential for adding conditions and error handling to smart contracts, providing better security and control over the execution flow.

**Features**

Implementation of require() statement to enforce specific conditions.
Usage of assert() statement to validate critical assumptions and detect bugs.
Utilization of revert() statement to revert transactions and provide error messages.

**Getting Started**
Prerequisites
To compile and deploy the smart contract, you will need the following:

Solidity compiler
Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat)
Ethereum test network or a local blockchain for testing

**Usage**
Open the Solidity file containing the smart contract in your preferred development environment.

Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.

Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum test network or a local blockchain.

Interact with the smart contract by calling its functions and observing the behavior of the require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

Examples
Below are some example interactions with the smart contract:

**Setting the value:**

solidity
Copy code
contractInstance.setValue(42);
Increasing the value:

solidity
Copy code
contractInstance.increaseValue(10);
Withdrawing funds:

solidity
Copy code
contractInstance.withdraw(50);
